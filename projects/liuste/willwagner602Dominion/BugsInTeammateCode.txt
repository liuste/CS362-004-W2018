Bug-Reports

1st Bug: I placed my unit tests inside the projects/liuste/willwagner602Dominion.  
I found a bug in the refactored village_effect function using both my unit test (called cardtest4.c) and my random test (called randomtestcard1.c).  
Both the unit test and random test reported that the handCount test FAILED.  If the village_effect function worked correctly, the handCount test should be true if asserted as 0.  
This is because the way the dominion code is setup, the discardCard function is called inside the card (in this case village card) so the handCount becomes 0.  
We can see that discardCard function was removed from William’s refactored village_effect function when compared to the master dominion code.  
The discardCard function should have been inside the card function like how it is inside the refactored smithy_effect function in William’s code.

2nd bug: The second bug is found in the refactored smithy_effect function using both my unit test (called cardtest3.c) and my random test (called randomtestcard2.c).  
Both the unit test and random test reported that the handCount test FAILED.  In the unit test, the handCount should be 7 but instead it was 8.  
Upon inspection of the smithy_effect function we see for (i = 0; i <= 3; i++) instead of the for (i = 0; i < 3; i++) in the master dominion code.  
This causes +4 cards instead of +3 cards.
